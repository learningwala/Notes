The starting point of our educational thinking is that there is a crisis in human society at multiple levels: personal, political and environmental. Personal and social problems are mirrors of each other, and are intimately connected. In other words, human needs and desires have created the social structures we live in today, and any examination of these structures or any attempt to change them must at least begin with an examination of personal, “subjective” emotional patterns.

My basic questions are:

> Is there a different way of living, both in personal and in social terms, that is not conflict ridden but essentially peaceful and whole? What role does education have in this process?

When I say “learning,” I don’t only mean academic or text-based learning but an inquiry into the complex daily process of life, thought and emotion.

**How to facilitate this kind of education ?**

> Learning does not happen through teaching; it happens through meeting. — Martin Buber

I believe that transformative learning happens through human relationships, dialogs, powerful experiences & reflections.

I am passionate about co-creating dialogic spaces with children & young adults. 
Where we share creative adventures, tools for reflection, and we embark on 'journey of growth'.
