Hello Bhavesh bhai,

This is Mihir Pathak, I came to your place in Bangalore with Tultul. I also came with my partner to meet mahendra dada.
I am going through some chronic health issues so I thought let me write you for right direction. 

I am writing to discuss two ongoing health concerns :

1. Chronic Headaches
I have been experiencing headaches for the past two years, primarily affecting my forehead and the center of my head. These occur most frequently during summer months, though I've had occasional winter episodes as well. Local doctors attributed this to low blood pressure (my most recent reading was 90/96) and prescribed folic acid tablets, paracetamol, and ORS. While these provide temporary relief, the underlying issue persists.

2. Digestive Issues
I'm experiencing significant digestive problems that include:
- Stomach pain triggered by even mildly spicy foods or restaurant meals
- Blood in stool
- Extended time needed for bowel movements
- Severe leg pain following bowel movements

Previous medical interventions include:
- Endoscopy (results were normal)
- Naturopathy treatment in Vadodara
- Dietary modifications including switching to millet-based foods, which provided some relief

However, any deviation from a strict diet (even minimal spicy or heavy foods) triggers symptoms and indigestion.

I'm seeking your guidance on:
- Long-term management strategies for both conditions
- Ways to strengthen my digestive system
- Any specific tests you would recommend

Please let me know if you need any additional information to better assess my situation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Thank you 
Mihir Pathak
