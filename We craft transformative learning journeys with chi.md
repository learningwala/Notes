Values we hold dear

When we’re fearless, we’re the best version of ourselves

And that’s why, ‘the whole child’. For everyone to bloom, they need to develop every facet of their personality.  Not just education, or vocation. Our learning programme has experintial projects combined, with realtionship with sakha - Mentor. All the ingredients to help every child become the best version of themselves.

Transformative experinces + Relationship with sakha brings
out everyone’s best version of themselves. 

Transformative experinces : Theater, Nature Exploration, Travel, Residential camps, Interdisiplinary Project
Realtionship with sakha : Enter into the being of the student, accepting them unconditionally. Create an enabling space that allows them to recognize and release the weight of assumptions and beliefs. Encourage them to take bold leaps into the unknown and embrace the seamless flow of life. Reflect together on the experiences of learning and unlearning from those ventures. Cherish the friendship that blossoms through this shared journey.

If we can’t sustain it, we don’t do it

What’s the point, right? We don’t believe in doing projects with kids and ‘moving on’. Our responsibility to our children is until they can support not just themselves, but a little bit of world around them. That’s the joy for us. Creating more humans who can help more humans.
