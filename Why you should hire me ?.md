Why you should hire me ?

Core philosophy : 

- I believe that child is independent being 
- I believe that teacher's job is to give space and environment for child's natural development 
- I believe that learning happens through genuine / authentic relationships / friendship and as educator I am more interested in that.

Knowledge of pedagogy and child development & learning 

I have experience and training in following pedagogues 

- Nature based learning 
- Theater in education 
- Project based learning 

- I am part of faculty team of 'child development and learning course' by Eklavya Foundation & Delhi University 
- I am taking guest lecture at Communities and Family Studies (Child Development Department) of M.S University, Vadodra. 

Experience 

- I am working with children and teachers since 2013. This includes spending time with children average 5 hrs a day for 11 years. 

- It might seems that I never worked with one institution for long time. In my understanding, it was phase where I was finding my voice and philosophy of education. I think I have found that now. Now the phase is to work at one place for long period. 

At other aspect of life : I am getting married in Feb 2025. So I am looking for more stable work opportunity. 

Connection with role :

- I can do facilitation, developing a lesson plans
- I can design curriculum and collaborate with different teams for that
