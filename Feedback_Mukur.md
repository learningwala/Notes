0.06 : The VO saya एक दशमलव सात शून्य, I think that shunya is not needed.
The pronunciation of economy (when the VO says in english sounds a bit odd)
I feel that linear economy and circular economy are little complicated terms so an introductory slide/image with examples as infographics should be added before we start explaining how they work.
0.55 : When VO says प्राकृतिक संसाधन, the TOS is a water stream, there can be some more examples of Natural resources like Sun, Wind, Coal/petroleum etc.
1.38-1.42 : The visuals somehow don't add up to the VO. In the video we are talking about how the circular economy works, a single example of any product would help in better understanding. 
2.27 There’s a huge Red coloured question mark, which should be changed to some other color keeping in mind the color blind viewers
3.16: The VO says इसका कुछ और उपयोग कर सकते हैं ? but the visuals are just piles of clothes. We can show bags being made from old clothes or anything else.




Feedback_Mihir 

The Beginning of the video is a little abrupt. 
0:17 to 0:22 : the rotating earth should dissolve little early /faster 
0:22 to 0:23 : इतना कचरा पैदा ही क्यों होता है ? (this should be TOS)
0:37 to 0:47 : symbols used for explaining liner economy can be different / this colour is not grabbing attention 
0.55 : When VO says प्राकृतिक संसाधन, the TOS is a water stream, there can be some more examples of Natural resources like Sun, Wind, Coal/petroleum etc.
1:37 : VO says चक्रीय अर्थव्यवस्था भी यही करती है and visule is plastic bottle in water stream. This visual is not appropriate 
1:52 : video stops and then TOS starts. We should decrease the time between them
0:57 : Here the visual should be women working in a recycling center (similarly to 1.45 to 1:47)
2:19 to 2:24 : this shot is too long. Also there should be TOS - हम चक्रीय अर्थव्यवस्था से कैसे जुड़े। 
2:56 : for the challenge there should be visual of electronics, daily use things like brush, comb, plastic container used for food, packet of sanitary napkins, plastic plates 





Feedback - Kirti
0.01 - The VO sounds very aggressively loud at the beginning and boring throughout. Need to change.
0.04 - The TOS should show the figures with zeroes adding to the screen to make it 1.70 lakh tonne. 
0.05 - The VO for decimal is not required. Please simplify it. For ex - for 1.5 lakh we don’t say 1 dashamlav 5 lakh, rather we will say - dhed lakh. (hope you get it).
0.15 to 0.18 - The question asked should also come as TOS
0.23 - 0.24 - The questions asked should also come as TOS
0.35 - Linear economy ‘L’ should be capitalized.  
0.37 to 0.48 - TOS like Resources extraction, production, consumption and dispose should be in Hindi. 
0.52 - The visual can be of some fossil fuel-extracting plant instead of flowing water
1.07 and 1.18 - The TOS - Production, Consumption, Collection, Recycling should be in Hindi. 
We have stated the english term for raikhik arthvyavastha that is linear economy but have not done the same for chakriya arthvyavastha. 
1.08 - Consider adding - चक्रीय अर्थव्यवस्था को अंग्रेजी में Circular economy कहा जाता है। 
1.16 - चक्रीय अर्थव्यवस्था can be added at the centre of the circular graphic. 
 1.59 - VO should say - आज हम जिसे कचरा मान रहे है, वो रीसाइक्लिंग ke द्वारा….. Currently it says recycle dvara
 2.05 - When you give an example of PET or HDPE, you are assuming that the viewer already knows about it. Can we keep it simple and add plastic bottle or plastic can?
2.12 - can we look for alternative of ‘kaccha maal’. It has been used twice in the video and sounds odd. 
2.28 - The question should come as TOS
2.58 - The challenge should come as TOS

Feedback_Kedar sir

The video is looking fine. However, can we add a few more examples of the circular economy in action? For e.g. as we had discussed, the conversion of food waste to manure which can be used to grow food again. Or an example of refill where an old paint bucket or shampoo bottle can be refilled with new material instead of the packaging being thrown away?

Start the VO a couple of seconds after the visuals start
1.7 लाख टन should also come as TOS

0:22 - 	Add TOS: इतना कचरा पैदा ही क्यों होता है? 
Economy is not pronounced correctly. Re-record the word Linear Economy (try both these - इकॉनोमी / इकॉनॉमी)    

0:38 - 0:49 - 	The terms should be bilingual. Hindi terms + English terms. 
                     	Change the gray graphics. They are bad and do not stand out. 
                     	Blur the background even more and add a gray/ black tinge so that the graphics are highlighted better.  

0:46 - 	Mihir Pathak please check the script. VO has mispronounced आखिर में as आधिर में. Rre-record the sentence. 

1:00 - 	Pause the VO before going to the next point about ‘लेकिन अब बड़ी संख्या में …’    
Also the visuals should change when talking about ‘लेकिन अब बड़ी संख्या में …’ . Right now we are still showing the plastic in drain footage. 

1:06 remove the gap in the VO between चक्रीय अर्थव्यवस्था _ की ओर 

Remove the English terms inside the circle. 

1:08 add a sentence in the script and VO - अंग्रेजी में इसे circular economy कहते हैं। 

1:15 - 1:20 Stock footage. Doesn’t really suit the VO. Also don’t use that circle graphic again. Mihir Pathak suggest more suitable visuals to show how there is no wastage in nature. Media team may not be able to shoot it but can use copyright free footage. 

1:30 - Add TOS प्रकृति में कुछ भी बेकार नहीं जाता। 

1:38 - 1:47 Instead of showing random footage of scrap, use a blank screen with graphics. Show the linear economy graphics in one straight line to match the VO and then remove those graphics to add circular economy graphics. 

1:50 - Add TOS पुनःउपयोग 

2:10 - Add 2 more detailed examples of circular economy as suggested by Kedar 

2:25 - Add a pause in VO before going to the next point. Change the colour red of the ? 

2.44 - The TOS should change to match the VO

2:55 Re- record the word Challenge. It should sound like चॅलेंज 

2:57 - the entire challenge should appear as TOS.  

3:10 - VO has not pronounced the word उपयोग ख़त्म हो जाने पर
