A dream for Khoji Club

Khoji club remains a space of healing, acceptance, dialogue and co-creation.
Khoji club acts as an incubation center,
For children, faculty, and parents.
Where we learn, experiment, challenge ourselves, and thereby break barriers and grow in our lives. 


Khoji club becomes a movement where ethos of 'dialogic education'
seep into families 
percolate into society 
communities 
and get replicated in other educationalist institutions
