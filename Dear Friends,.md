Dear Friends, 

We are excited to welcome you to our wedding ceremony. 
We are writing this msg to seek your support.

This wedding is big deal for us, It tool long time and efforts to convince families and co create this life event.
We did many compromise during this process. One of the compromise is not doing eco - friendly event management. 

Yes there will be plastic glasses and other non eco friendly things in our event. We tried our best to avoid but we are failed against convenience and status image. People don't want to do any inconvenient action and they feel that drinking from same glass will be unhygienic and not going good with our status. 

We are requesting you to please understand and support us in this. Few invitations from our side :

- Bring your own water bottle if possible or find out steel glass at venue for drinking water 
- Don't use tissue paper for cleaning your plat, use your handkerchief or ask for rough cloth 
- If you are coming together, pool the cab / vehicle 
- keep eye on things where ever you find out non eco friendly practice, try to find alternatives as per the situation.

Don't stretch yourself too much. Take it as creative problem solving activity and enjoy :)

looking forward to see you soon.
