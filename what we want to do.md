We want to create transformative learning experiences for children & young adults through 
Theater + Nature/Outdoor exploration + interdisciplinary projects & more

Through regular sessions, workshops, yatras, residential camps & more 

we are not claiming 21st century skills, holistic education or anything that sorts

our intention is to give give experiences to children where they can feel something inside, they express, something get changed in the inner world. There are no fixed learning outcomes. 

our intention is to explore this questions together : how can we learn to live together?, how we can be more sensitive, flexible?, how can we expand our ways to be happy?, how can resolve the conflict?, how to bring 'wonder' back in our life?, how can we feel our creativity?, how can we connect to the nature, how can we be self aware ?

We also want to be companion of teenagers and young adults if they want to take gap year and do self design learning projects, internships & more
