Project intentions : 

- developing nature based learning program for primary grade children (Grade 1 to 7)
- developing research questions and write papers about it 
- developing an evaluation tool for the program impact 
- creating a open source module / frame work for other teachers/ educators / parents 


The basic idea of this project is to do action research on nature based learning. we want to work with 15 to 20 children from primary grades (mix age group). We will meet them twice a week and do nature based activities with them which includes story telling, watching films, going for nature walk, doing science experiments, making something, meeting new people, doing arts - music and dance.. 

core idea is to facilitate children to make connection with their own surrounding with the lens of curiosity and wonder. 
trees, plants, insects, soil, water and more.
