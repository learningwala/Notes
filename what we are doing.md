**I craft transformative learning journeys with children and young adults through experiential methodologies:**

I am working with children, young adults and educators since last 11 years. I have worked with a formal & informal learning spaces during this journey. 

My core interest is developing life skills & environmental consciousnesses through theater, outdoor & interdisciplinary project based transformative experiences.

I also work with teenagers as companion in their self directed journey / gap year

Inspired from the philosophy of J.Krishnmurti, Martin Buber & science of child development I work with educators to help them to create transformative learning experiences in their context/learning spaces.

When I’m not with children or educators, I immerse myself in writing poetry or documenting my ’learning experiments'.

Music, long walks, bird watching, singing, and sketching are my favorite time accelerators.



I am a passionate educator, working with children, young adults, and fellow educators for the last 11 years. I create transformative learning journeys using experiential methodologies, including theater, outdoor and nature-based explorations, and interdisciplinary projects.

My work is deeply inspired by the philosophies of J. Krishnamurti, Martin Buber, and the science of brain, learning, and child development. I focus on building genuine relationships with children, fostering life skills, ecological consciousness, and exploring the Panchkosha model of human development.

I am part of the core team for the 'Child Development, Learning & Special Needs' course at Eklavya Foundation and a proud recipient of the Earth Educator Fellowship (2022-23), supported by the Youth Conservation Action Network.
