What we will do if there is no constrain of money, no constrain of failing? what type of work we want to do ?

if there are no constrain I would find out residential school in Gujarat and work directly with chidren. 

- I will go on nature walks, do citizen science projects, tracking, residential camps, bird watching group
- I will introduce books, poems, songs, stories, theater & music like never before. Working on their affective domain and sensitivity. 
- I will do many projects making, tinkering, farming, documentation, geo inquiry project, film making project, starting own theater company and more. All with the center idea of 'Environment stewardship'

- I will also spread this work in schools / learning spaces around. Talking to teachers, parents and more. Doing workshop / camps with children and educators.
- I will write stories, article, make videos, develop educational materiel and more to share these ideas
- I will collaborate with local university and share the joy of nature based learning with them 
- I will also spend my time mentoring / sharing my experiences with Earth Educator fellows

- In future I will support/encourage teenagers to take gap year / take up a green career path / internships

----
My primary intention for next few years 

> Working directly with children documenting it 
> Sharing my insights through material development, narrative building and mentoring young educators 

This is what I want to do and Nidhi is also in agreement for most of the things. I want to be in gujarat because of language. I can thrive when I am with children and talking in Gujarati / Hindi. I know songs, I write poems, I do theater in that language. That gives me like a super power. I know local name of birds, names of trees, names and stories of river and that's what I want to introduce to children.

I can go to Bangalore and join alternative school / I can come to coonor and work in schools there but my soul is here. 

On other side I like being part of young educator's journey. I would like to be companion, I would like to share my insights & experiences.
In that way Earth Educator Fellowship is very close to my heart. That's why I already volunteered to be part of it.

What can we do now ? let's come back to reality : 

- we both don't have money to work like this in Gujarat. Schools will not hire us if we are not teaching subjects. If school is ready to give us freedom to work they don't have funds to pay us. So we need to find some alternate funding method to fund our work. 

CSR will not work. What are other methods - individual / retail funding , find out some remote job. (Doing remote job in pratham was an attempt to find that alternate funding. It didn't work). 

we are contacting few reach people with our proposals. let's see how it goes. 

one more idea : Can I work remotely for YouCAN ? I can contribute in organizing / peer mentoring - Earth Educator Fellowship, I can also help in alumni development. I can travel in between to visit different fellows, I can also contribute in material development / translation and more. 

see if it sounds valuable to you guys. In any case I would like to volunteer for the fellowship. But if there is any possibility to work remotely, It will be great. In that case we will able to work directly with children and also supports other educators to be in this path. 
let me know what do you think.
