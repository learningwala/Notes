**I craft transformative learning journeys for children and young adults**

I believe that schools are not preparing individuals for rapidly changing world. School kills creativity, self-esteem, and most importantly, sensitivity in individuals, which has larger implications on society.

> Transformative learning : Transformative learning is a process where individuals critically examine their assumptions, beliefs, and worldviews, leading to profound personal change. This type of learning is more than acquiring knowledge; it involves shifts in how individuals perceive themselves and their place in the world. Transformative learning often occurs through experiences that challenge the learner's current understanding, prompting reflection and new interpretations.


I believe that transformative learning happens through human relationships, dialogs, powerful experiences & reflections.

I am passionate about co-creating dialogic spaces with children & young adults. 
Sharing creative adventures, tools for reflection, and inviting them for 'journey of growth'.
