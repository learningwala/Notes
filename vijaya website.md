Transforming Lives Through Care and Education

Vijaya Foundation is a philanthropic organization based in Gujarat - India.






Vijaya Foundation is a philanthropic organization dedicated to two key areas: 

1. Senior Citizen Care

We provide essential support to senior citizens in need, focusing on grocery and food aid. Currently, we serve vulnerable seniors in Bhavnagar, Gujarat, ensuring their well-being through our compassionate services.

2. Education

We believe holistic education has the power to transform lives. Our educational initiatives focus on fostering creativity, socio-emotional development, and environmental awareness. We currently support three programs:

Interdisciplinary Library Program (Ages 3-11):
This program nurtures young minds through storytelling, theater, nature-based activities, and curated children's literature. Operating in three learning centers in Vadodara, the program encourages language development, creativity, and environmental consciousness while helping children build essential socio-emotional skills.

Local Khoji - Project-Based Learning Program (Ages 12+):
In this initiative, children embark on interdisciplinary projects centered around their city or town. Whether conducting research, storytelling, filmmaking, or engaging in making, tinkering, and coding, participants develop critical 21st-century skills and deepen their connection to the environment.

Annual Residential Camps (Ages 10-16):
Every December, we host a 3-day residential camp, offering children an immersive experience through themes like collaboration, communication, and community living. These camps provide hands-on activities that foster personal growth and shared learning.
