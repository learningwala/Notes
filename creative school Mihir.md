I am passionate educator working in a formal and informal learning environments for the past 11 years.

I am passionate about :

    Project based learning programs

    Movement & Theater based programs

    Nature / Outdoor based programs

    Workshops, Residential camps, Yatras, Internships, Weekly meetups,

    Developing informal learning spaces (Clubs, Maker Space, Library, Studio).

I did my schooling till 10th in Gujarati Medium from small town in Vadodara - Gujarat. 
I dropped out of school after 10th grade and did many internships / explorations in the field of theater, marketing, website development and more. Also started small firm for website development. During that exploration I discovered these books totochan, summerhill, sudbury vally school, Gijubhai badheka, Arvind Gupta. I was always interested in working with children because of my mom who is kindergarten teacher. 

I had decided that time that I want to be an educator. Educator who inspires children. I started doing arvind gupta toys workshop with children and slowly I discovered project based learning, theater in education & nature based learning. I worked in different type of schools from CBSE, IB, Residential school to home schooling group.

What is education for me right now ?

As human species, we are struggling. Struggling to stay together, listen to each others perspective, struggling to think - reflect and be sensitive.

wars - social media addiction - conflicts in relationship with family - community and nature. I feel alternative education is important to me because the traditional education system is just increasing the struggles, moreover adding fuel to this struggle.

can we build the environment with vision to develop curious, sensitive, well adjusted, happy human beings ? For me, alternative education is not about learning new skills or subjects. Those things are part of it but not the only thing.

Alternative education is a space where we have genuine relationship with children. relationship like friend / sakha / mitra - there is no fear, no authority, relationship which is growth oriented.

Where…adult can share their interest, children join them, they learn together. They find resources together. sometime children share their ideas and all join.. where.. we ask fundamental questions like what is freedom ? what is happening inside us? how can we live together ? How our relationship with nature should be? where.. we stretch our self to explore our self from the core.. where we bring different exposures and flavors…

for me alternative education is that betweenness of children and sakha, sakha and sakha, children and peers..

3. As a sangha other than subject specific work, teachers need to engage in
community service (Seva), and one’s own self-care and wellbeing practices
towards inner transformation and outer productivity. Will you be willing to
extend your time towards these needs?

Yes I believe that education is all about 'living' not just 'Teaching'. Community living, Community Service is the core of our educational work.
I am willing and more interested in that apart from Subject teaching.
