Questions for you:
(for context, I will be interacting with 30 fifth graders of the IGCSE/Cambridge curriculum in Chennai for the YouCAN fellowship)

1. How to build a curriculum that uses storytelling as a pedagogical tool? What are some resources I can refer to?

- use films on chennai's different eco systems, use books - books on ants, butterfly, dragonfly and connect it with activity. There is nothing there. 

2. How can I best build a youth-led project and teach them the same?

- citizen science tools, films, space to meet and discuss 

3. How do we build a place-based curriculum that will be interesting for the kids to engage with?

- visit different palces, make maps, meet people, collect stories 

4. Any suggestions on how to build our tools and aids for children- and make it as inclusive as possible?

The WildEd project in Visakhapatnam seeks to bridge the growing disconnect between children and nature. In a world where nature is increasingly seen as distant, this initiative introduces children to the richness of their local environment through immersive and hands-on Natural History Education. By creating a Portable Natural History Museum and integrating nature into the school curriculum, WildEd aims to foster wonder, curiosity, and an understanding of the interconnections within local ecosystems.
The project will engage children in exploring common species, biomes, and ecosystems in Visakhapatnam, along with the cultures and livelihoods tied to them. With an emphasis on experiential learning, children will connect with nature through activities like nature walks, citizen science, and interactive museum displays, cultivating a deeper sense of coexistence.
Additionally, WildEd will collaborate with local schools, providing teacher training workshops to help integrate nature education into the curriculum. This will be supplemented by citizen science projects, encouraging students to apply their learning in real-world contexts. Through this initiative, WildEd aims to build a sustainable, scalable model for nature-based learning that can be replicated in other regions, with a focus on promoting eco-literacy and increasing outdoor engagement among children in Visakhapatnam.
Questions for you:
a. To specifically learn about case studies and approaches on child development, language pedagogy, life skills learning, incorporating theater, nature explorations and interdisciplinary projects.
b. What do schools in specific look for if they want to engage in Nature education programs? What is the model through which Ekalavya works with schools?
c. To get feedback on Passion Project and how to raise resources for the same.

Project Title: Friends of Goa
Location: Goa, Saligao, Pilerne
In Goa, a state blessed with natural beauty, the rapid development and real estate boom are posing a serious threat to the environment, especially its ancient forests. The disconnect from nature has led to a lack of awareness about its value, particularly among children who are increasingly disconnected from the outdoors. The Friends of Goa project seeks to address this issue by creating meaningful, nature-based experiences for children aged 8-12, through outdoor activities like nature walks, art (painting, pottery, theatre), and storytelling. By fostering a connection to the environment, the project aims to instill a sense of home and respect for Goaâ€™s natural heritage. Hosted at the Museum of Goa in Saligao, the sessions will allow children from local government schools to explore the flora and fauna around them, develop artistic skills, and build confidence. Through these sessions, the goal is to reconnect the younger generation to nature and inspire them to protect it for future generations. Sessions will be held once a week, with the potential to increase frequency based on feedback.
Questions for you:
A lot of your work seems to be centered around curriculum building. Can you tell me a little bit about this process from scratch? What methodologies, processes and philosophies do you apply, if any? How do you tailor it to suit the learner's needs, apart from age related considerations? Especially if there are children from financially disadvantaged background?

Do you also take into account emotional development when we speak about child development? How do you integrate that into your learning modules?

What are some of the main challenges you face working with people from various backgrounds? Any tips on how to get them all to common ground?

What has your experience been working with local governing bodies or local authorities?
