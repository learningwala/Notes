Dec 2024 Camp 

This note is for camp organizers and close / core group to read and discuss the future of our innervation. This includes some sensitive information about child which we should not share directly with parents. 

General :

- Time / Duration of camp : This time we got 1 full day and two half days with children. Which is better than last time but still we feel, we need more time. Specially when children are coming after 6hrs of traveling. Next time we can think of doing it with proper 5 days camp so we can at least get 3 full days to be with each other.

- Place selection : This time place was not appropriate for our camp. There were daily visitors from outside, DJ sound, Food was not so great / unhealthy, there were no proper set up to do guided sessions with children. Last time's place was good, we can think about repeating the same.

- Operations : This time devang bhai was not there, we missed him. But Ronak bhai and other team members did a great job to manage the logistics. They never interfered in the activity but some time became a part of it which we highly appreciate 

- Activities : This time the agenda was give informal time to children to explore and bond. We consciously designed the activities like that so children get more time to think about what they did, make new friends and soak the whole experience 

First day 

- Games and body movement by Nishtha 
- informal time at bone fire

Second Day 

- Morning Nature Walk 
- Tree investigation activity by Nidhi 
- Adventure activities 
- Pinhole camera making, Puzzles and other activities by Nidhi & Nishtha
- some children played cricket, badminton 

Third Day 

- Morning zip line session 
- closing circle 

The overall intention of the camp was : children get informal / semi structured time with mix age group to bond, explore new things, come out of own comfort zone, stretch own self little to bit to tryout new things, just be, do nothing - nothing for exam or from textbook, just to follow the curiosity. 

during the camp children get to know their self better. What are the skills they have, what are their fears, what they like, when they feel happy. School don't allow to do these things.

This time in the camp there were space were children sat in a silence, when they asked questions from their inner curiosity, there were spaces where they spoke out their heart very openly, sometime they shared their fears and other emotions.. we helped each other to grow, evolve. 

Some incidents / Highlights 

- Vyom shared wonderful experience of seating in silence. He shared that some ninja cartoon is going on in his head when he closes his eyes. (In today's world, seating in silence is gift which we can give it to our children.)
- We went for the nature walk second day. We asked children to gather natural things in one matchbox.let's see how who can gather more. Around 4 - 5 children got interested in the whole thing did excellent job. Kavit, Trisha, Freya, Vishwaraj did excellent job. Specifically trisha's matchbox was full of verity of objects (Intention behind this activity was - children do more fine observation and get engaged during the nature walk)

- During the nature walk Jesal and Manush asked questions about different tree and birds. They were genuinely curious about the things 

- During the one of the session, there were one bird giving call outside the window. Jesal, Manush, Viya, Trisha, Freaya got interested to know more about that bird. They asked questions. We used merlin app to identify the bird. It was a blue flycatcher.

- First day night Viya and freya came to our place and we had 20min long conversation about school, what she likes about school and what she like in camp and other stuff. Children get very less time now days to talk to other people apart from their age group. Just talking without agenda. Not just about studies but about life in general 

- During adventure activities. Trisha got stuck. She was in tears and didn't want to go further. Nidhi and Nishtha had talk with her & she got ready to try it out. She came out of her comfort zone and tried it. Enjoyed it. These children gave us many learning opportunities. 

- While making pinhole camera, in the starting children persevered it as craft activity. But after making the model they were asking questions, they were giving reasoning about how it works. That conversations holds so much value to us. Because schools don't have that type spaces. We wish to create that type of spaces more and more.

--

overall it was good imitative. But still it is adult driven, activity oriented imitative. I wish one day 'space' will take over the center role. One day relationship or friendship take overs the central role. 

imagine we do walking pilgrim to sabarmati to dandi with children. How much learning is involved in that ? without any activities or sessions, think about 500km cycling trip, think about group of teenage children living in one home for a month doing all the work by themselves - chores, cooking, doing their personal projects, lots of play.. all in limited budget.. Imagine children are making their own short film..

we wish if we can do regular session with children every month and make camp as place based / relationship based initiative. 

For next time: 

we should 

- start regular monthly sessions with children at Ahemdabad 
- make core committee of 5 people to plan the camp. Which include 2 children representatives. We should 
- make a list of atleast 5 space where we can do the camp, 
- we need to make a list of diverse facilitators, list of age appropriate, child specif interest and also - we need to have physical parents meeting to talk about children's observation. 

How to sustain this efforts financially ?

We really believe that "you can't destroy master's house with master's tools". You can't and should not do business in education / culture building work. We really believe that we don't want to make business as usual.

Work of education is long term work. You can see tangible result very soon. It's not like product or service. 

While we really want to high quality work with children. We wish if group of visionary people support this work financially. We don't want to make it like product for example : per person per camp 10k rupees. Instead of that we want to do it continually with high quality with good documentation and will announce crowd funding opportunity. Who ever believes in our work can support us with no fix amount.

we would offer this as a gift, with no fix price tag. People who believe in this goodness will defiantly support us. 

we can even make small donor circle / group who can support with small amount to this imitative every year.

if we can't sustain, we will not do it : This is not job or money making effort for us. It is our life's work, so we will not compromise with our values to make it sustainable. If society don't want to support it, we will do it in small scale or we will close it and do something else. BUT we will not make it a product at any cost.
