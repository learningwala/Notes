Hello Ram, 
I had a talk with Nidhi about the project. As I shared with you, we are designing our work where some projects can fulfill our financial needs and apart from that we will contribute to project like ecosystem enrichment. 

we have decide that, to begin the project we can start with 10 hrs per week. So me and Nidhi will give 10 - 10 hours, total 20 hours per week. 


Details :

Approximate time contribution : 20hrs per week 
Honorarium : 20k per month + travel, food, stay (if there are any visits / travel plans)

First month (starting from 1st March) : 

- setting up the structure of the project, writing concept note, basic timeline of the project, identifying stakeholders, etc.
- second step will be research, cataloging, documenting, interviewing orgs, people and more. 

We will keep re visiting the time and action this project needs. If we feel that we are not able to give enough time for this, we will find out team and make this work sustain. 

also if we find that we want to get more involve and give more time, we will share that with team and discuss. 

me and nidhi both have different skill set and constrains. I will not able to travel because of my full time commitment. Nidhi can do that. 

We both will attend the meeting and decide the tasks among ourselves. Mostly nidhi will do background research, data management, cataloging work. I will try to help in overall structure, communication and more.

The project is still in idea stage so we can start with this and revisit it again after 1 month or so.

let me know how do you feel about this. 

Thank you 
Mihir & Nidhi
