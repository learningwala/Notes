# Subject Matter Expert for Self-directed Learning (SME-SDL)

## About CM Youth Center: Transforming Education in Meghalaya

The Government of Meghalaya has embarked on an innovative educational initiative in partnership with Sauramandala Foundation (www.sauramandala.org) and Project DEFY (www.projectdefy.org). Together, we have established 22 rural Self-Directed Learning (SDL) centers, known as the Chief Minister's Youth Centers (CMYC). These centers represent a revolutionary approach to learning, moving beyond traditional educational frameworks to foster genuine curiosity and self-directed growth.

Each CMYC functions as a vibrant community hub featuring:
- A Nook: A dedicated SDL space where learners explore their interests through hands-on projects
- Modern Library: Curated resources supporting diverse learning paths
- Arts & Theatre Program: Fostering creative expression and cultural connection
- Sports Program: Promoting physical wellness and team building
- Entrepreneurship Development: Nurturing business acumen and innovation

Our centers serve as bridges across the digital divide, particularly in rural areas, by providing internet access and creating opportunities for innovative learning and entrepreneurship development. The program's unique approach welcomes learners of all ages, transforming each center into a true community learning space.

## What is Nook?
"Nooks" are educational centers for self-determined learning, or -- in short -- "schools without teachers". They enable the members of a local community to carry out their own learning projects based on individual interests and needs.
