How to sustain these efforts financially ?

We really believe that "you can't destroy a master's house with master's tools". You can't and should not do business in education / culture building work. We really believe that we don't want to do business as usual.

Work in education is long term work. You canâ€™t see tangible results very soon. It's not like a product or service.

While we really want high quality work with children, we wish a group of visionary people to support this work financially. We don't want to make it like a product for example : per person per camp 10k rupees. Instead of that we want to do it continually with high quality with good documentation and will announce crowd funding opportunities. Whoever believes in our work can support us with no fixed amount.

We would offer this as a gift, with no fixed price tag. People who believe in this goodness will definitely support us.

We can even make a small donor circle / group who can support with a small amount to this imitative every year.

if we can't sustain, we will not do it : This is not a job or money making effort for us. It is our life's work, so we will not compromise with our values to make it sustainable. If society doesn't want to support it, we will do it on a small scale or we will close it and do something else. BUT we will not make it a product at any cost.
